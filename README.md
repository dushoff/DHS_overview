* What information is available from DHS? Where is it and what are the file names? This is an older, scraping-based approach. I am still in the middle of rescuing it from the wiki (and haven't quite decided yet whether it's worth the time).

* We can still download; it selects "standard" datasets and makes nice tables and Makefiles.

* We want to make chained rules to download things and convert them

* We also want more query stuff -- for example, we should be able to select world regions and data sets that have HIV biomarkers
